# personal-page-v1
A mock-up of my first personal page

V1 because I would like to re-do this in React.js once I get more comfortable with the framework. 


## To-do:

- Add media queries for responsivity

- Add a burger bar for smaller screens

- Develop an actual color scheme (and follow it...)

- Follow the typography system

- Finish the portfolio slider (but it works!!!)

- Add an effect on the navbar to make unhighlighted items have a slight opacity
